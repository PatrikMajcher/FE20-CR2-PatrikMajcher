# Task Manager

Task Manager is a simple web application created using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks dynamically by loading data from a JSON source. The application features a unique importance rating system, allowing users to set task priorities on a scale from 0 to 5, with corresponding color codes (green for 0-1, yellow for 2-3, and red for 4-5). Additionally, the application provides a sorting functionality based on task priority.
